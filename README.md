# AI Trading Signal Generator

An advanced machine learning system that analyzes NASDAQ market data and generates real-time buy/sell signals with stop loss, take profit, and probability estimates.

## üÜï NEW: Continuous Learning

The system now **learns from its predictions in real-time**:
- ‚úÖ Tracks every prediction and its actual outcome
- ‚úÖ Records accuracy metrics continuously
- ‚úÖ Automatically retrains the model when enough new data is collected
- ‚úÖ Adapts to changing market conditions
- ‚úÖ Shows live learning metrics (accuracy, model version, etc.)

## Features

- üìä **Real-time Data Fetching**: Automatically fetches 5-minute candle data from NASDAQ
- ü§ñ **Machine Learning Predictions**: Uses Random Forest classifier with 30+ technical indicators
- üí∞ **Complete Trading Signals**: Generates signals with:
  - Entry price
  - Stop loss levels
  - Take profit targets
  - Success probability
  - Risk/reward ratio
  - Signal strength rating
- üìà **Technical Indicators**: RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Stochastic, ATR, ADX, and more
- ‚ö° **Live Monitoring**: Continuous real-time signal generation
- üß† **Continuous Learning**: Automatically learns from predictions and retrains model
- üìä **Performance Tracking**: Real-time accuracy metrics and model versioning
- üíæ **Persistent Learning**: Stores all predictions and outcomes for long-term improvement

## How Continuous Learning Works

1. **Prediction Tracking**: Every time the model makes a prediction, it's recorded with timestamp and confidence
2. **Outcome Recording**: After 10 minutes (2 candles), the system checks if the prediction was correct
3. **Accuracy Monitoring**: Tracks overall accuracy and recent performance (last 50/100 predictions)
4. **Automatic Retraining**: When 50+ new outcomes are recorded, the model automatically retrains with fresh data
5. **Model Versioning**: Each retrain creates a new model version, tracking improvement over time

## Installation

### Step 1: Install Python Dependencies

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Install TA-Lib (Windows)

TA-Lib requires special installation on Windows:

1. Download the appropriate wheel file from: https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#ta-lib
   - For Python 3.11 64-bit: `TA_Lib‚Äë0.4.28‚Äëcp311‚Äëcp311‚Äëwin_amd64.whl`
   - For Python 3.10 64-bit: `TA_Lib‚Äë0.4.28‚Äëcp310‚Äëcp310‚Äëwin_amd64.whl`

2. Install the wheel:
```powershell
pip install path\to\downloaded\TA_Lib‚Äë0.4.28‚Äëcp311‚Äëcp311‚Äëwin_amd64.whl
```

Alternatively, you can try:
```powershell
pip install TA-Lib-binary
```

## Usage

### 1. Train the Model

First, train the model with historical data:

```powershell
python train_model.py
```

This will:
- Fetch 60 days of historical 5-minute candle data
- Calculate 30+ technical indicators
- Train a Random Forest model
- Display training accuracy and feature importance
- Save the model to `trading_model.pkl`

### 2. Run Live Trading Signals

Once trained, start the live signal generator:

```powershell
python live_trader.py
```

This will:
- Monitor the market every 60 seconds
- Generate predictions for the next candle
- Display BUY/SELL signals with full trading parameters
- Show probability of success and signal strength
- **Track predictions and learn from outcomes**
- **Automatically retrain when enough data is collected**
- **Display live learning metrics**

### 3. View Learning Metrics

The system automatically displays metrics every 50 iterations and when stopped:

======================================================================
```

## Configuration

### Change the Stock Symbol

Edit `train_model.py` or `live_trader.py`:

```python
SYMBOL = 'QQQ'   # NASDAQ-100 ETF
# Or use any other stock:
# SYMBOL = 'AAPL'  # Apple
# SYMBOL = 'MSFT'  # Microsoft
# SYMBOL = 'GOOGL' # Google
# SYMBOL = 'TSLA'  # Tesla
```

### Adjust Risk Parameters

Edit `live_trader.py`:

```python
self.signal_gen = SignalGenerator(
    risk_reward_ratio=2.0,      # Minimum R:R ratio
    atr_multiplier_sl=1.5,      # Stop loss distance (ATR multiplier)
    atr_multiplier_tp=3.0       # Take profit distance (ATR multiplier)
)
```

### Change Check Frequency

Edit `live_trader.py`:

```python
CHECK_INTERVAL = 60  # Check every 60 seconds
```

### Enable/Disable Continuous Learning

Edit `live_trader.py`:

```python
LEARNING_ENABLED = True  # Set to False to disable learning
```

### Adjust Retraining Parameters

Edit `live_trader.py` in the `check_and_retrain` method:

```python
self.tracker.should_retrain(
    min_new_samples=50,          # Minimum outcomes needed before retrain
    max_hours_since_retrain=24   # Maximum hours between retrains
)
```
